# CorDapp Minimum and Target Platform Version

## Overview

We want to give CorDapps the ability to specify which versions of the platform they support.

This will make it easier for CorDapp developers to support multiple platform versions, and enable CorDapp developers to ["tweak behaviour and [...] opt in to changes that might be breaking (e.g. sandboxing)"](https://cordaledger.slack.com/archives/C3J04VC3V/p1534170356000500).

This document proposes that CorDapps will have metadata associated with them specifying a minimum mlatform version and a target platform Version. The minimum platform version of a CorDapp would indicate that a Corda Node would have to be running at least this version of the Corda platform in order to be able to run this CorDapp. The target platform version of a CorDapp would indicate that it was tested for this version of the Corda Platform.



## Background

> Introduce target version and min platform version as app attributes
>
> This is probably as simple as a couple of keys in a MANIFEST.MF file.
We should document what it means, make sure API implementations can always access the target version of the calling CorDapp (i.e. by examining the flow, doing a stack walk or using Reflection.getCallerClass()) and do a simple test of an API that acts differently depending on the target version of the app.
We should also implement checking at CorDapp load time that min platform version <= current platform version.

### Definitions

* *Platform version (Corda)* An integer representing the API version of the Corda platform 

> It starts at 1 and will increment by exactly 1 for each release which changes any of the publicly exposed APIs in the entire platform. This includes public APIs on the node itself, the RPC system, messaging, serialisation, etc. API backwards compatibility will always be maintained, with the use of deprecation to migrate away from old APIs. In rare situations APIs may have to be removed, for example due to security issues. There is no relationship between the Platform Version and the release version - a change in the major, minor or patch values may or may not increase the Platform Version.
  
([from the docs](https://docs.corda.net/head/versioning.html#versioning)). 

* *Platform version (Node)* The value of the Corda platform version that a node is running and advertising to the network.

* *Minimum platform version (Network)* The minimum platform version that the nodes must run in order to be able to join the network. Set by the network zone operator. The minimum platform version is distributed with the network parameters as `minimumPlatformVersion`.
 ([see docs:](https://docs.corda.net/network-map.html#network-parameters))
 
* *Minimum target version (Network)* Does not exist yet. We are planning to introduce the minimum target Version as part of the network parameters. This document assumes that it indicates to nodes in the network that they should not run CorDapps with a target version lower than this.

* *Target platform version (CorDapp)* Introduced in this document. Indicates that a CorDapp was tested with this version of the Corda Platform and should be run at this API level if possible.

* *Minimum platform version (CorDapp)* Introduced in this document. Indicates the minimum version of the Corda platform that a Corda Node has to run in order to be able to run a CorDapp.


## Goals

Define the semantics of target platform version and minimum platform version attributes for CorDapps. Describe how target and platform versions would be specified by CorDapp developers. Define how these values can be accessed by the node and the CorDapp itself.

## Non-goals

In the future it might make sense to integrate the minimum and target versions into a Corda gradle plugin. Such a plugin is out of scope of this document.

This document does not concern itself with how the _minimum target version_ should work.

## Timeline

This is intended as a long-term solution. The first iteration of the implementation will be part of platform version 4 and contain the minimum and target platform version. The minimum target version will be implemented after that.  

## Requirements
  
* The CorDapp's minimum and target platform version must be accessible to nodes at CorDapp load time.

* At CorDapp load time there should be a check that the node's platform version is greater or equal to the CorDapp's Minimum Platform version.

* API implementations must be able to access the target version of the calling CorDapp.

* The node's platform version must be accessible to CorDapps.

* The CorDapp's target platform version must be accessible to the node when running CorDapps.

## Design

### Testing 

When a new platform version is released, CorDapp developers can test their CorDapp against that version and increase its target version. This way they would opt-in to potentially breaking changes that were introduced in that version. If they choose to not increase the target version, their CorDapp will continue to work. The only scenario in which the target version has to be increased is when the minimum target version of the network is set to a higher value.
    
### Implications for platform developers

When new features or changes are introduced that require all nodes on the network to understand them (e.g. changes in the wire transaction format), they must be version-gated on the network level. The minimum platform version in the network parameters would have to be changed the version these features or changes are introduced in.

Changes that risk breaking apps must be gated on targetVersion>=X where X is the version where the change was made, and the old behaviour must be preserved if that condition isn't met.

## Technical Design

The minimum- and target platform version will be written to the Manifest of the CorDapp's JAR, in fields called `Min-Platform-Version` and `Target-Platform-Version`.
The node's CorDapp loader reads these values from the Manifest when loading the CorDapp and adds them to `net.corda.core.cordapp.Cordapp`, which can be obtained via the `CorDappContext` from the service hub. For cases where the service hub is not available, it is possible to do a stack walk to find the class and thus classloader of the last app on the stack. This way it is also possible to make caller-sensitive APIs.
